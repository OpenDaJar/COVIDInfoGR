# COVIDInfoGR
A small informative application about the status of COVID-19 Pandemic in Greece


This application is a simple illustration of the data taken from iMEdD (https://github.com/iMEdD-Lab/open-data). 
We also used MPAndroidChart in order to make some diagrams. There are still some bugs in this version but nothing major and hopefully we will resolve them in the near future.

Also, implemented some swipe-top and swipe-bottom gestures to make navigation a bit faster.
